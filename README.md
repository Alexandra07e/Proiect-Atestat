# ðŸ“š Subprograms â€“ Informatics Graduation Project  

This project is my **Informatics graduation thesis (Atestat)**, focusing on **subprograms** as a fundamental concept in programming. It includes both a **theoretical study** and the implementation of a **complex problem** solved through modular programming techniques.  

---

## ðŸ§  Core Topics  

- **Definition & Types** â€“ Functions, procedures, recursive subprograms  
- **Parameter Passing** â€“ By value, by reference  
- **Variable Scope** â€“ Local vs. global, lifetime of variables  
- **Advantages** â€“ Modularity, reusability, maintainability  
- **Best Practices** â€“ Clear naming, documentation, and testing  

---

## ðŸ›  Practical Problem  

- **Language Used** â€“ *C++*  
- **Complexity** â€“ Decomposed into multiple subprograms for clarity  
- **Functional Blocks**:  
  - Input/Output handling  
  - Data validation  
  - Core algorithm implementation  
  - Auxiliary processing functions  

---

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used  

- **IDE** â€“ *Code::Blocks*  

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Verification  

- Individual testing of each subprogram  
- Integration testing for the complete workflow  
- Example inputs and outputs provided in documentation  
- Code reviewed for readability and performance
