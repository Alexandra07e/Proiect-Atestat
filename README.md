Subprograms â€“ Informatics Graduation Project
ðŸ“– Overview
This project is my Informatics graduation thesis (Atestat), focusing on the concept of subprograms in programming.
It combines a theoretical presentation of subprograms with the implementation and analysis of a complex problem solved using subprograms.

The goal is to:

Explain the concept, structure, and advantages of using subprograms.

Demonstrate their practical application in solving a challenging programming task.

ðŸ§  Theory
The theoretical section covers:

Definition of subprograms (functions & procedures).

Classification: parameterless subprograms, subprograms with parameters, recursive subprograms.

Parameter passing methods: by value, by reference.

Scope and lifetime of variables.

Advantages: modularity, code reusability, easier debugging, improved readability.

Examples in pseudo-code and a chosen programming language.

ðŸ’» Practical Problem
The practical part presents a complex programming problem that requires:

Dividing the solution into multiple subprograms for clarity and maintainability.

Combining algorithmic thinking with good programming practices.

Using subprograms for:

Input/output handling.

Data processing.

Specific algorithmic tasks.

Modular decomposition of the solution.

Programming language: (specify here, e.g. C++ / Java / Python)
IDE used: (e.g. Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code)
